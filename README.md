An Application created for the Norwegian longbow society, for competition management.

This is in many ways a side project, dont expect any speed on dev.
The aim for the App is to be a one stop shop for runing a Archery competition.
Planned features include:

* Paricipant/member registry
* competition registration
* Support for 
  * Flight competiton
  * Field competiton
  * Historial round
* Printed scoring cards
* Results registration
* Result Print out
* Result statistics over time
* Web app for scoring
* Mobile app for scoring

This is a very ambitious list of features. This is a project for me to expand my skills as a programmer.
I am not certain that I will be able to create this, but it will be fun nontheless.

ps. Before anyone asks, the name of tha app is infact inspired by the protagonst of Horizon Zero Dawn.
